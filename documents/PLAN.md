1. Conceptualize the Game Idea:

main genre = Strategy
sub genre = Tower Defense
Narrative:
- Articifial Intelligence suddenly went rogue and is trying to destroy every living thing in existence. You as a Grunt Guardian have to protect your galaxy from misery, by traveling to as many planets as you can and killing its minions.


Visual style:
    - Planet defending:
        - Cannon & the enemies will be made using vector graphics 
        - Planet background will be made by using our bro
    
    -Planet hopping:
        - The background of the whole scene, will be a photo of space in PNG format
        - Photos of each planet are in PNG form with transparent background


2. Design the Game Mechanics:

What are the core mechanics? For example, the defense of planets and hopping between 2D and 3D environments.
defense of planet mechanics:
    - Shooting the enemies with the cannon
    - Rotating the cannon to shoot enemies
    - Powerup mechanics:
    If you receive a power up you can use it instantly by pressing space (maybe will implement inventory to store the powerups)
    
    Guardian/Cannon Mechanics:
        - Guardian has a cannon
        - Guardian has 3 lives each worth 100HP

    Powerups:
        - Double time = cannon will shoot twice as fast
        - Double cannon = you will receive a secondary cannon
        - Instant kill = you will one shot the enemies 
        - Double xp = you will receive twice as much xp for 10seconds 
        - Big ass bullet = Cannon will shoot a big ass bullet that explodes and does damages surrounding the area (there is different kinds of big ass bullets)
            big ass bullets:
                - Snowball:
                    Visual: Big snowball that will leave snow behind
                    Effect: Slows the enemies going through it 
                - Ceaster egg bullettio:
                    Visual: Easter egg (hihi)
                    Effect: Ask VJ veli k√§yks kunnon duunis?
                - Firebomb:
                    Visual: Reddish-orange cannonball with a flame motif.
                    Effect: Causes a small area of fire damage over time where it lands.
                -  NUKE:
                    Visual: Nuke from cod zombies
                    Effect: Destroys everything, there is 1/100 chance of it destroying the guarding as well
                -  Electric charge:
                    Visual: Bright yellow with jagged edges, resembling a spark or bolt of lightning.
                    Effect: Upon explosion, it sends out a chain lightning effect that jumps between nearby enemies.
                            How will the player interact with the game? Think about controls and user input.

    Enemy mechanics:
        - Planet type will determine the enemies
        - When killing an enemy theres a chance that it drops a powerup

    Planet mechanics:
        - Each planet has a required XP to complete (which depend on the users level and what type the planet is)
        - There will be 5 waves of enemies, each wave will increasingly more difficult
        - When you complete a planet you receive 10HP back.

        - Different types of planets:
            Lava Planet:
                Characteristics: Fiery environment with rivers of lava and volcanic eruptions.
                Gameplay Element: Periodic eruptions could send waves of lava or fireballs across the play area, providing both obstacles and potential tools against enemies.
                Required XP to complete: 
                Unlock level: 10
            
            Ice Planet:
                Characteristics: Frigid climate with ice structures and frequent snowfall.
                Gameplay Element: Slippery terrain affecting movement, and icicle formations could be shot to fall on enemies.
                Required XP to complete: 
                Unlock level: 3

            Jungle Planet:
                Characteristics: Dense forests, vibrant flora, and teeming with wildlife.
                Gameplay Element: Thick foliage could hide enemies or power-ups, and some areas could be inaccessible until cleared or traversed via treetops.
                Required XP to complete: 
                Unlock level: 5
            
            Desert Planet:
                Characteristics: Sandy dunes, scarce water sources, and ancient ruins.
                Gameplay Element: Sandstorms could temporarily limit visibility and slow down movement, while quicksand pits could trap enemies.
                Required XP to complete:
                Unlock level: 1 

            Ocean Planet:
                Characteristics: Mostly water-covered with small islands and underwater cities.
                Gameplay Element: Tides and currents could affect projectile trajectories, and players might need to defend both above and below the water surface.
                Required XP to complete: 
                Unlock level: 2

    

What are the rules of the game, and how does a player win or lose?
Rules: 
    -The game will last as long as the guarding has hp
    -The game end when the guarding loses all lives:
        - 3 lives each is 100hp
        - each enemy that reaches the guardian ddoes damage to it (different enemies do different damage)



3. Plan the Game Structure:

Outline the game's levels or stages.
Decide on the progression system - how does the game advance from one level to the next?
Sketch out the main interface elements, like menus, score displays, and inventory systems if applicable.
4. Develop Technical Specifications:

Choose a game development platform or engine, like Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, etc.
Determine the server-side requirements if your game has an online component. Will you need databases, user authentication, etc.?
5. Create a Prototype:

Start with a simple prototype that includes the most basic version of your game.
Use placeholders for graphics and sounds to test mechanics and gameplay flow.
Iteratively design and test each game component (e.g., the guardian/cannon system, planet details).
6. Test and Iterate:

Playtest the prototype and gather feedback.
Refine and adjust game elements based on the feedback.
Implement additional features like graphics, sound, and more complex levels after the basic gameplay is fun and engaging.
7. Plan the Development Phases:

Break the project into manageable phases.
Create a timeline for your project, allocating time for design, development, testing, and deployment.
Consider the scope of your game - keep it doable within your timeframe and resources.
