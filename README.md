If you want to create a 3D planet hopping game using JavaScript, you can still follow a modular approach to separate the game logic into its own section or module. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Create a New JavaScript File for Planet Hopping:**
   - Start by creating a new JavaScript file specifically for the planet hopping game logic (e.g., `planet-hopping.js`).

2. **Define and Organize Game Logic:**
   - In the `planet-hopping.js` file, define and organize the game logic related to "3D" planet hopping. The 3D will be fufu meaning we will use 2D space and make it work 

3. **Export Game Logic Functions and Classes:**
   - Use the `export` keyword to export the relevant functions, classes, or objects that other parts of your application need to interact with. These exported elements should encapsulate the core gameplay mechanics.

4. **Separate HTML and CSS:**
   - Keep any HTML elements and CSS styles related to the 3D planet hopping game in separate HTML and CSS files. This helps maintain a clean separation of concerns.

5. **Import and Use the Module:**
   - In your main JavaScript file (e.g., `main.js` or `app.js`), import the planet hopping module and use its exported functions or objects to initialize and control the game.

   ```javascript
   // main.js

   // Import the planet hopping module
   import { initializePlanetHoppingGame, startPlanetHopping } from './planet-hopping.js';

   // Call functions or use objects from the module as needed
   initializePlanetHoppingGame();
   startPlanetHopping();
   ```

This modular approach allows you to encapsulate the 3D planet hopping game logic in a separate module while keeping your code organized and maintainable. You can focus on developing the 3D gameplay within the `planet-hopping.js` file, while other parts of your application can interact with it as needed.
